# Contributing

If you find a missing feature or an error, feel free to open up an issue, be sure to describe the issue, paste any error output and ideally, provide the affected files. If you're feeling like writing a fix/feature yourself, drop in a pull request; linking it to an issue where the change is discussed would be ideal, otherwise, i'd have to guess what you wanted to do in the PR.
